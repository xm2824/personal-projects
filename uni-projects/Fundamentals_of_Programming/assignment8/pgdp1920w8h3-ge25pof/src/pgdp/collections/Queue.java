 * !!!  I've tried to write my codes in an unque way to prevent similary codes, i.e. to avoid extreme coincidence.
 * !!!  E.g.
 * !!!  1) writted javadoc for each funcion...
 * !!!  2) clear documentations or idea of the codes
 * !!!  3) some instructions are in the same line...
 * !!!
 * !!!  Since last year I gave one of my friend my codes for testing which lead to plagiarism( he forgot to delete it...),
 * !!!  so I can't take any risk this time,seriously speaking!
 * !!!  Thank you for your understanding, really!
