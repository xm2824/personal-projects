 * !!!  This code is written alone by ge25pof TaoXiang and recorded, if any illegal plagirasim happens, I will fight for my unguilty
 * !!!  through legal approaches. (e.g. with the recorded videos)
 * !!!  And my codes has been written in a special way to prevent some extreme cases of similiarity, i.e. to avoid extreme coincidence.
 * !!!  Some examples are like:
 * !!!  for(int i_ge25pof = 0;i_ge25pof < 10 ; i_ge25pof++) 
 * !!!
 * !!!  Since last year I gave one of my friend my codes for testing which lead to plagiarism( he forgot to delete it...),
 * !!!  so I can't take any risk this time,seriously speaking!
 * !!!  Sorry if some variable names are too long to read, I would try to write clear documentations to help the tutors to read it.
 * !!!  Thank you for your understanding, really!
